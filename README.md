## Module 2 Challenge,coding with VBA in Excel
### First Code 
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
•	The ticker symbol
•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
#### 1-Algoritme 
 ##### Retrieval of Data 
•	The script loops through one year of stock data and reads/ stores all of the following values from each row:
 ###### o	ticker symbol 
 ###### o	volume of stock 
 ###### o	open price 
 ###### o close price 
 ##### Column Creation 
•	On the same worksheet as the raw data, or on a new worksheet all columns were correctly created for:
 ###### o	ticker symbol 
###### o	total stock volume 
   ##### o	yearly change ($) 	
   ##### o percent change 
 ##### Conditional Formatting 
•	Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the yearly change column 
•	Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the percent change column 
#### 2-Code "Module1
![Capture28](../main/)
#### 3-Execution Module1
•	The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:
### Second Code 
•	Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
#### 1-Algoritme 
##### Calculated Values 
•	All three of the following values are calculated correctly and displayed in the output:
o	Greatest % Increase o	Greatest % Decrease o	Greatest Total Volume 
##### Looping Across Worksheet 
•	The VBA script can run on all sheets successfully.
#### 2-Code "Module2
#### 3-Execution Module2
  The solution is  in the following image:
